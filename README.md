Application that generates pay slips for staff members

I worked through a book called Learn C# in One Day and Learn It Well by Jamie Chan and built software that generates the salary slips of a small company. The application takes staff members names and positions from a text file, in conjunction with the user input of their hours to calculate and generate pay slips for each employee. Depending on whether an employee is a Manager or an Admin, their pay is calculated differently.
